# Popular Repositories Characteristics



In this lab, we are going to study main aspects of the most popular open source systems.
Therefore, we will analyse how they are developed, on which frequency new releases are deployed, among
other characteristics. To do so, you must collect all the data necessary to answer the following questions about
the 1000 public GitHub repositories with most stars:

**RQ 1:** Are popular systems old/mature?  
*Related metric: repository age (years since its creation)*

**RQ 2:** Do popular systems receive a lot of external contributions?  
*Related metric: total number of accepted pull requests*

**RQ 3:** Do popular systems release new features constantly?  
*Related metric: total number of releases*

**RQ 4:** Do popular system get updated frequently?  
*Related metric: time since the last update*

**RQ 5:** Are popular systems writen using the most popular languages?  
*Related metric: repository primary language*

**RQ 6:** Do popular systems have a high number of closed issues?  
*Related metric: Ratio between the number of closed issues by the total number of issues*
