# A Study of the Quality Aspects of Java Systems

In the development process of open-source systems, in which many developers
can contribute on different parts of the code, one of the risks to be managed
is related to the repositories intern quality attributes evolution. That is, 
when adopting a collaborative approach, there is a risk of making vulnerable
aspects such as modularity, maintainability, or legality of the produced software.
Therefore, many modern approaches seek to refine such process through
the adoption of practises related to code revision or static analyses
using CI/CD tools.

In this context, this project objective is to analyse quality aspects
of repositories developed using the Java language, correlating them
to aspects of the development process, from the perspective of product
metrics calculated using the [CK](https://github.com/mauricioaniche/ck) tool.
